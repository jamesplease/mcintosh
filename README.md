# McIntosh

A blog documenting IA/UX/design notes and issues for iOS/macOS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it is
built into a static site using [React Snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap).

### Developer Scripts

- `npm start`: Run the development server.
- `npm run deploy`: Deploy the site.

### Notes

- Always use relative URLs. This is because the development server is hosted at the root,
  while the hosted app is not.
