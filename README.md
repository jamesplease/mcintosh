# McIntosh

A blog documenting IA/UX/design notes and issues for iOS/macOS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it is
built into a static site using [React Snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap).

### Developer Scripts

- `npm start`: Run the development server.
- `npm run deploy`: Deploy the site.

### Notes

- Optimize PNG files using [https://tinypng.com/](tinypng.com).
- The [ffmpeg cheatsheet](https://github.com/jamesplease/ffmpeg-cheatsheet) can be useful for generating the videos.
