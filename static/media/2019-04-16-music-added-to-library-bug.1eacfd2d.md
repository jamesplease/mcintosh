The "Added to Library" alert will close any other open menu when it disappears. To reproduce this, you must
open a menu while the "Added to Library" alert is open, and then wait for it the alert to close.

As a bonus, the spacing of the side panel gets stretched in an unusual way when you add the song to your library.
